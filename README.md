Hi, I'm Najib! I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building scalable and efficient web applications.
I specialize in React JS ⚛️ for front-end development and use MongoDB 🗃️, Express 🧩, and Node JS 🌐 for building robust back-end systems. 
I also have experience working with Laravel 💻 and MySQL 🗄️ for developing dynamic web applications. 
My toolbox includes Tailwind CSS 🖌️ for modern, responsive designs, Docker 🐳 for containerization, and Python 🐍 for various automation and scripting tasks.
I love learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.
Always up for a challenge!
